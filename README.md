CS50x: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project showcases my personal website using HTML, CSS, SASS, and Bootstrap.


File Descriptions:

HTML Pages
1. index.html >>> homepage about me, with a spiel about my background and passions
2. skills.html >>> list of my technical skills
3. work.html >>> overview of my work experience, affiliations, and projects
4. connect.html >>> links to my LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and Email

/scss/ folder:
1. custom.scss >>> SASS script for my custom CSS
2. custom.css >>> compiled stylesheet from SASS

/img/ folder: images used in the website



Important:

- SASS was run in my local computer and GitHub relies on the compiled CSS that was pushed.
- Bootstrap was downloaded and included in my local directory to conduct use of SASS and Bootstrap mixins. However, the bootstrap distribution was not uploaded to GitHub.
